    Python interface to interact with EGI Netstation

    simple.py is a wrapper for a single-threaded version,
    threaded.py is a, eh, threaded version,
    may be there would also be a "multiprocessed" one.

    2019-07-17: I started refactoring this codebase (finally) for Python 3.x. Current candidate is 3.7, but should work
        fine in any 3.x Python environment. Will do further housecleaning on this codebase and testing as time permits
        in the following weeks.
